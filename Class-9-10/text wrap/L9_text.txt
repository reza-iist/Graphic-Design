Here at Buzz Soda, we create craft organic soda. What sets us apart is something uniquely delicious and nourishing: honey. We love our bees, and make a point of cultivating our honey using fair and sustainable harvesting practices. Raised at our brewery, the bees are also create honey for our many farmers markets in the area.
Using honey in soda is something uniquely Buzz Soda. Millenia ago, the Egyptians used honey to create a drink called Meade, so while we are not the first to use honey in a drink, we are the first to use it in a refreshing soda drink. With less refined sugar and a more appealing flavor than other soda, you will enjoy our three main flavors: original Buzz soda, cherry Buzz soda, and grapefruit Buzz soda.
Buzz Soda is the newest and tastiest evolution in soft drinks! We hope you will give us a try the next time you are looking for a refreshing drink. Since it is crafted with honey, Buzz Soda is also packed with antioxidants that offer a wide range of health benefits.
